= Jenkins Monitoring

When deployed by the provided Jenkins Monitored templates, 
Jenkins is configured to expose its metrics to Prometheus.

Note: This template requires user to have permission to create `servicemonitor` 
objects in the namespace where jenkins needs to be deployed, this can be 
achieved by creating a specific `clusterrole` and bind it to the user.

```
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: servicemonitor-edit 
  labels:
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
rules:
- apiGroups: ["monitoring.coreos.com"]
  resources: ["servicemonitors"]
  verbs: ["create", "update", "patch"]
```

And add this role to user in the targeted namespace:
```
oc adm policy add-role-to-user servicemonitor-edit user -n namespace
```
