= Providing Jenkins cross project access

If you are going to run Jenkins somewhere other than as a deployment within your
same project, you need to provide an access token to Jenkins to access your
project.

.Procedure

. Identify the secret for the service account that has appropriate permissions
to access the project Jenkins needs to access:
+
----
$ oc describe serviceaccount jenkins
Name:       default
Labels:     <none>
Secrets:    {  jenkins-token-uyswp    }
            {  jenkins-dockercfg-xcr3d    }
Tokens:     jenkins-token-izv1u
            jenkins-token-uyswp
----
+
In this case the secret is named `jenkins-token-uyswp`

. Retrieve the token from the secret:
+
----
$ oc describe secret <secret name from above> # for example, jenkins-token-uyswp
Name:       jenkins-token-uyswp
Labels:     <none>
Annotations:    kubernetes.io/service-account.name=jenkins,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=32f5b661-2a8f-11e5-9528-3c970e3bf0b7
Type:   kubernetes.io/service-account-token
Data
====
ca.crt: 1066 bytes
token:  eyJhbGc..<content cut>....wRA
----

The token field contains the token value Jenkins needs to access the project.
